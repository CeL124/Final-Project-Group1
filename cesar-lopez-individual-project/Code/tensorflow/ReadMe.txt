Please read me to understand what needs to be done for the code to run.

Python 3.5.2

The important libraries used are:

TensorFlow
Keras
Wget
NumPy
Warnings
Time

You can install all the packages and libraries by pip installing the requirement text file. Since the code is ran in python3, it would be best to use pip3. 

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

After doing this, you can run the code. I used GPU from AWS EC2 instance, so if you do not have a powerful GPU, this code may take a while to run or may produce a memory error.
